## Materials We Provide
<!--- This section is a table of contents for the lesson. The table structure breaks down typical lesson resources into types, distinguishing between lesson notebooks and other supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lesson | Interactive jupyter notebook with structured lesson content | [Link](./explainable-models.ipynb)|
| Relevant Video | The Era of Blind Faith in Big Data Must End  | [Link](https://www.ted.com/talks/cathy_o_neil_the_era_of_blind_faith_in_big_data_must_end) |

## Learning Objectives
<!--- This section lists the learning objectives of the lesson. For information on how to write clear learning objectives, see: http://ii.library.jhu.edu/2016/07/20/writing-effective-learning-objectives/ --->

- Describe some examples where data science and machine learning have been misused.
- List high-level areas of concern in data science ethics.

## Additional Resources
<!--- This section lists useful reference materials that can inform, extend, or deepen a student's understanding of the material. While this may seem like a "nice to have" feature, we normally see a range of advanced and remedial students in our classes. Curating these resources allows us to provide targeted materials and suggestions that instructors can use to support different student needs. --->
